      <h1>carEthics</h1>
      <p>Self-driving cars need to make decisions about what to do in different situations. Some of those situations might involve the life of a human.
          But who should be making those decisions? Programmers, CEOs, our President?<br>
          Ethics is a tricky question with no definite right or wrong answer and ends up being whatever the majority thinks.<br>
          So, I think the morality of our self-driving cars' decisions should also be left up to the majority.<br>
          This is a little game to crowd-source the data for those decisions. This is by no means an exhaustive list of possibilities, but rather an interesting thought experiment for how this data collection method could go.<br>
          <br><u><b>Instructions</b></u><br>
          There are three options. The option on top, the option on the bottom, and the option to drive into a wall and kill yourself.<br>
          Your responsibility is to pick whichever option you want your self-driving car to take.<br>
          At the end, you'll see your results as a bar graph showing the number of instance in which you selected a person (or persons) to kill.
