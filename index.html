    <p>Howdy, I'm Zechariah Robinson. Call me Zack.</p>
<p>I'm a Master’s student in the Human Centered Design and Engineering program at the University of Washington where I am using my background in Psychology to specialize in user experience (UX) research.
I’m interested in a career as a UX Researcher where I can improve designs for consumer technologies. That is, products people use because they enjoy using them such as video games, phone apps, virtual reality, etc.
In my free time I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, practicing a new skill, traveling and blogging, and rereading Harry Potter.</p>
